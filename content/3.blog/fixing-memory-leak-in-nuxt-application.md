Memory leaks are one of those elusive bugs that can degrade your app’s performance over time, resulting in slow load times, crashes, or even application downtime. In this post, we’ll talk about what a memory leak is, how it manifests in a Nuxt application, and the steps you can take to fix and prevent these leaks from happening.

Let’s dive into the process of understanding, detecting, and fixing memory leaks in Nuxt applications.

## :UIcon{name="i-mdi-memory"} What is a memory leak?

A memory leak happens when an application allocates memory but fails to release it after it’s no longer needed. Over time, the application consumes more and more memory, eventually leading to performance degradation or a complete crash.

As memory usage continues to rise, the server can start to struggle to handle requests, such as delivering assets (images, JavaScript, CSS files) or rendering pages. In this state, users may experience slower load times. In server-side rendered Nuxt applications, the server is particularly vulnerable to memory leaks, as it handles multiple users simultaneously.

JavaScript’s garbage collector automatically frees up memory when data is no longer needed. However, it doesn’t always release memory effectively, especially when persistent resources like event listeners, timers, or reactive objects that remain active after a component unmounts are not properly cleaned up. These types of leaks can occur on both the server side and the client side. In this post, we will primarily focus on server-side memory leaks, since Nuxt builds and runs the same code on both the server and client sides and any leak is unwanted.

## :UIcon{name="i-mdi-exclamation-thick"} I think I have a memory leak

Once you’ve identified that your application is facing a memory leak, the first step is to mitigate the immediate problem. The simplest action is to restart the application. This clears out the accumulated memory and lets the application continue running, albeit temporarily.

While this is a stop-gap measure, it might be important, especially in e-commerce or production apps, to keep the application running during investigation. If your shop or service is live and you can’t afford downtime, restarting buys you time while you investigate the root cause of the memory issue. Restarting resets the memory usage, but it doesn’t solve the underlying issue. You need to dig deeper to find out why the memory leak is happening in the first place.

## :UIcon{name="i-mdi-database-search"} Debugging with heap dumps

Once your application is running again, the next step is to capture heap dumps. A heap dump is essentially a snapshot of your application’s memory at a particular point in time. By comparing memory states at different times, you can pinpoint what’s leaking and not being properly cleaned up by the garbage collector.

Here’s how you can use heap dumps to debug:

- Take a heap dump before the application crashes—this will help you see what the memory looks like in its problematic state. Please see documentation how to do it: :UrlLink{to="https://nodejs.org/en/learn/diagnostics/memory/using-heap-snapshot" label="Node.js Heap Snapshots"}
- Restart the application to reset memory usage.
- Take another heap dump after restarting, when the memory is in a clean state.
- Open Chrome DevTools (or Node.js tools) to inspect the heap dumps
  - Open `chrome://inspect/#devices`
  - Open dedicated DevTools for Node
  - Open the memory tab and load both heap dumps.
  - Compare the two snapshots: look for objects that are growing in size, such as arrays, strings, or Vue.js reactive objects that aren’t getting cleaned up properly.

This will give you a clear view of what objects are taking up memory and allow you to investigate whether specific components, data structures, or modules are responsible for the leak.

## :UIcon{name="i-mdi-page-next-outline"} Debugging by isolating routes

Another effective way to debug is to isolate specific pages or routes that could be responsible for the memory leak. To do this, you can stress-test your application using tools like Autocannon:

- Start by running your application locally with the `-debug` flag, e.g., `node server.js --debug`.
- Use Autocannon to simulate heavy load on different page
  - first, target the homepage and capture a memory dump
  - then, target specific pages like the category, product, or CMS pages, and create new memory dumps for each.

By comparing these memory dumps, you can identify which pages cause memory to increase abnormally. If memory usage spikes drastically on a particular page, you’ll know that page contains a memory leak.

If you were not able to find the cause on specific routes, then you can start by removing plugins, modules, and middleware that are handled globally in Nuxt and test the memory state after each removal. This will help you narrow down the culprit.

For instance, if memory usage normalizes after disabling a specific plugin or middleware, you’ve likely found the source of the problem. If not, continue isolating components by temporarily removing parts of the page like specific components, header, or footer and retesting.

## :UIcon{name="i-mdi-git"} Git bisect

If the memory leak seems elusive, another valuable tool is `git bisect`. Git bisect helps you track down the exact commit that introduced the memory leak by performing a binary search through your Git history.

Here’s how to use it:
- Use `git bisect start` to begin the process.
- Mark the last known good commit (before the memory leak) and the first bad commit (where the memory leak occurs).
- Git will automatically check out commits between the two, allowing you to run memory tests at each step.
- Run your memory tests (such as Autocannon) at each checked-out commit to determine whether the memory leak is present or not.

Eventually, git bisect will identify the exact commit where the memory leak was introduced, enabling you to pinpoint and fix the issue.

## :UIcon{name="i-mdi-format-list-bulleted-square"} Common issues

Some of the most common causes of memory leaks in Nuxt applications include:

- **Data fetching**: Not properly managing data-fetching operations on the server can lead to memory issues, especially when large datasets are fetched and held in memory unnecessarily.
- **Redirects**: Endless redirect loops can cause memory usage to skyrocket as the browser or server keeps allocating resources for each redirect.
- **Intervals and timeouts**: Forgetting to clear setInterval or setTimeout can cause memory leaks as these continue to run even when they’re no longer needed.
- **Event listeners**: Failing to remove event listeners (e.g., addEventListener) when components unmount can result in lingering memory usage on the client side.

## :UIcon{name="i-mdi-chart-box-plus-outline"} Monitoring

To prevent memory leaks from occurring in production, continuous memory monitoring is essential. Before each major release, run memory tests on all key pages of your application. For an e-commerce website, this includes pages such as the homepage, category page, product page, and cart page. Additionally, if your site has different views for products (e.g., product with variants) or categories (e.g., listing vs. detailed view), ensure you test both variations.

Here are some tools you can use for memory monitoring:

- :UrlLink{to="https://clinicjs.org/" label="Clinic.js"}: This tool is excellent for visualizing the memory footprint of your application. Use Clinic Doctor to generate graphs that show memory usage across different pages and observe any significant growth patterns.
- :UrlLink{to="https://github.com/mcollina/autocannon" label="Autocannon"}: Use Autocannon to simulate traffic and observe how memory is allocated during load tests. Prepare a script to run Autocannon against specific URLs such as the homepage, category page, product page, and any variations like product pages with different views.

Be cautious of pages that load large amounts of data—some memory growth is natural, but be vigilant for unnatural memory spikes, where the application consumes significantly more memory than expected. These spikes typically indicate a memory leak and should be investigated further.

## :UIcon{name="i-mdi-arrow-down-right-bold"} In summation

Memory leak can stop you from development for some time until you resolve it. Once you’ve identified and fixed the problem, apply preventive measures like memory monitoring to avoid leaks in future.

By staying proactive, you can ensure that your Nuxt application will run smoothly without memory-related performance issues.
