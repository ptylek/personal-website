I'm Pawel, a passionate frontend developer from Krakow. I specialize in **Nuxt**, creating **headless** frontend storefronts that breathe life into **[e-commerce]{.whitespace-nowrap}**. My expertise extends to **Vue** and **React**, two of the most dynamic **JavaScript** frameworks.

Currently, I work at Creativestyle, where I'm dedicated to engineering solutions that not only build websites but also drive business success. I've also contributed to the open-source community as a Magento maintainer.
